## Overview

Parkinson's disease is a progressive neurological disorder that affects movement. Early and accurate detection is crucial for managing the disease effectively. This project focuses on building a machine learning model to classify individuals as having Parkinson's disease or not, based on voice measurements.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is from the UCI Machine Learning Repository and contains biomedical voice measurements from 31 people, 23 with Parkinson's disease. The features include various voice recordings and measurements, such as fundamental frequency, jitter, shimmer, and harmonic-to-noise ratio.

## Installation

To get started with this project, clone the repository and install the necessary dependencies.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/parkinsons-disease-detection.git
cd parkinsons-disease-detection
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

### Data Preprocessing

Before training the model, preprocess the data to ensure it is clean and ready for modeling.

```python
python preprocess.py
```

### Training the Model

Train the machine learning model using the preprocessed data.

```python
python train.py
```

### Evaluating the Model

Evaluate the trained model's performance on the test data.

```python
python evaluate.py
```

### Making Predictions

Use the trained model to make predictions on new data.

```python
python predict.py --input data/new_data.csv
```

## Models

The project explores various machine learning models to identify the best performing model for Parkinson's disease detection. The models include:

- Logistic Regression
- Support Vector Machine (SVM)
- Random Forest
- Gradient Boosting
- Neural Networks

## Results

The performance of each model is evaluated using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. The results are documented in the `results` directory.
